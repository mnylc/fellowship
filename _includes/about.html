                     <h2 class="section-subheading">Institutions and the Reverse Pitch</h2>

                <p class="large">The first call for proposals, projects, and ideas, will focus on METRO member institutions. Members are invited to submit real-world challenges or problems of practice that are informed by their experience and daily operations. This exercise is sometimes referred to as the ‘reverse pitch’. The reverse pitch helps entrepreneurs focus on solving real world problems instead of innovating within a vacuum.</p>
                        
                <p class="large">As reverse pitch ideas are submitted, they will be reviewed and published anonymously to this site. Each submission will then be open to comments from the membership. METRO staff and a fellowship advisory council will also work with  each institution behind the scenes to understand and refine their pitches. This process will ignite instigations and provocations for potential fellows. In addition, it will begin to surface some of the hidden opportunities for cross-institutional collaborations.</p>

                <p class="large">Institutions submitting a reverse pitch might consider the following questions: Do you offer a library service that needs to be completely rethought and redesigned? Does your organization have a digital humanities project that you've been hoping to kick off, but haven't had the resources or time to pay attention to? Is there an opportunity to better engage your library in critical librarianship and social justice issues?</p>
                
                <p class="large">The pool of submitted pitches will determine areas of inquiry for this cohort of METRO fellows.</p>


                <p class="large" style="color:#009973">* The call for reverse pitches will open February 1st.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-subheading">Individuals and their Fellowship Proposals</h2>

                <p class="large">After the pitches have been published and promoted, the fellowship application process will open. Individual applicants will focus their project proposals within one or more designated areas of inquiry. METRO will publish all of the fellowship project proposals to this site. This gives the membership another opportunity to view, add comments, and share ideas.</p>

                <p class="large" style="color:#009973">* The call for fellowship proposals will open March 15th.</p>


<br /><br />

                    <h2 class="section-subheading">Matchmaking and Team Building</h2>
                        
                <p class="large">The matchmaking is where the magic happens. METRO and the advisory council will examine, consider, and assess the pool of reverse pitches alongside the fellowship proposals.  Together, they will bring fellowship proposals into alignment with needs that bridge multiple institutions.</p>
                        
                <p class="large">Because this fellowship is intended to take advantage of METRO as a unique network of libraries, archives, and museums, proposals that address problems across a diverse group of partners are best positioned for success. METRO and the advisory board will engage both member institutions and individual fellowship applicants to assure that we create strong partnerships that are well-positioned for success.</p>
